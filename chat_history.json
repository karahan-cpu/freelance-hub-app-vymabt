Now I can see the complete picture. The issue you're experiencing is likely that **you need to create clients first before you can create projects**.

Go to the \"Clients\" tab\n2. Tap the \"+\" button or \"Add Client\" button\n3. Fill in the client information (name, email, hourly rate, etc.)\n4. Save the client\n\n**Step 2: Create a Project**\n1. Go to the client detail screen and tap the \"+\" next to Projects, OR\n2. Navigate to create a project from anywhere in the app\n3. Select the client you just created\n4. Fill in the project details\n5. Save the project\n\n## Quick Actions Available\n- From the **Dashboard**: \"Add Client\" quick action button\n- From the **Clients tab**: \"+\" button in the header\n- From a **Client detail screen**: \"+\" button next to Projects section\n\nThe app will now properly guide you through this process and prevent the confusion you were experiencing.
